      <p>This is my sourdough right out of the oven! This was one of the first pretty loaves I made, so I was really happy and had to take a picture to send to my mom:)</p>

      <img src="assets/img/sourdough2.jpg" alt="Sliced sourdough loaf">
      <p>This is a picture of the inside of the loaf. It's great when you can get height and so many bubbles in the dough!</p>

      <p>Scoring different designs in the loaves and then seeing how they turn out is one of the most fun parts. I've recently started selling and delivering my loaves locally every weekend, and I love it! If you want a loaf, you should send me a message @marloaftonday on Instagram:)</p>
